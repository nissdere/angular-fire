Disclaimer: I’m not at expert at any of these technologies, just trying to explore and learn about them.

What is the MEAN (CEAN) Stack?

What is MongoDB?

What is Angular (Why did you say Angular 2 when that does not exist)?

What is Angular CLI

What is Express?

Why didn’t I use Wayne’s Restify Service instead of Express?


Quick Angular App

```bash
npm install @angular/cli -g
ng new project-name 
cd project-name

```
